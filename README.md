# Addition Program

## Product Goals
- Create a simple addition program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to input two numbers so that I can get their sum.
- As a user, I want the program to return the sum of the two numbers so that I can use it for further calculations or display it.

## Competitive Analysis
- There are many existing calculators and programming languages that can perform addition.
- Some calculators and programming languages may have additional features and functionalities.
- However, this simple addition program aims to provide a basic and straightforward solution for adding two numbers.

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a simple addition program that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. It should be easy to use and provide accurate results. The program should be able to handle both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimal numbers. The program should be developed using any programming language and framework. There are no specific requirements for the user interface or any additional features. The focus is on the core functionality of adding two numbers.

## UI Design
- The program does not require a user interface as it will be a command-line application.
- The user will input the two numbers as command-line arguments.
- The program will display the sum of the two numbers as the output.

## Input Format
- The program should accept both integers and floating-point numbers as input.

## Handling Invalid Input
- If the user enters non-numeric values or leaves the input fields blank, the program should display an error message and prompt the user to enter valid numbers.

## Constraints and Limitations
- There are no specific constraints or limitations on the size of the numbers that the program can handle. It should be able to handle numbers of any size without any loss of precision.
